Mailinary
==========

Scheduled mail delivery of web content

Basically what it does it scrapes a url and replaces it's content or parts of it with screenshots, and sends it as a mail message.

I had an attachment version but eventualy went with image hosting since mail messages where too large.
Cloudinary, and sends the resulting HTML as a  mail message.
