Mailinary
==========

Scheduled mail delivery of web content

Basically what it does it scrapes a url and replaces it's content or parts of it with screenshots, and sends it as a mail message.

I had an attachment version but eventualy went with image hosting since mail messages where too large.
Cloudinary, and sends the resulting HTML as a  mail message.


## Setup 

1. clone the repository 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:cloudinary/mailinary.git
```
2. install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```
3. populate your environment configuration file (.env) 

```

SMTP_PORT=YOUR_SMTP_PORT
SMTP_SECURE=0
SMTP_AUTH_USER=YOUR_SMTP_AUTH_USER
SMTP_AUTH_PASS=YOUR_SMTP_AUTH_PASS
CLOUDINARY_URL=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_URL
```
4. test with a one time mail delivery
```
bin/mailinary --url https://marketplace.clicdata.com/v/yYF0JrwBkrHw --subject "it works ðŸ”¥" --from reports@YOUR_DOMAIN --to YOU@YOUR_DOMAIN --selectors '#dashboard'

## Debugging tips

1. Turn off headless mode - sometimes it's useful to see what the browser is
   displaying. Instead of launching in headless mode, launch a full version of
   the browser using  `UI_DEBUG=1`:

        UI_DEBUG=1 bin/mailinary --job jobs/schedule/sample


### But i don't have a Cloudinary account

You can sign up for a [free account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) .

To this date (nov 2018) Cloudinary's free plan includes 25 monthly credits (1 Credit equals 1000 transformations or 1GB of managed storage or 1GB of monthly viewing bandwidth)
which is more than plenty if you have a daily mail process in place.
